SPLITTING DATA.CVM
==================

To split DATA.CVM into usable files, use chrrox's quickbms script, which

IMPORTING MODELS INTO BLENDER
=============================

import_valkyria is a Blender 2.63+ script for importing MLX, HMD, and ABR
models from Valkyria Chronicles. To use it, you have to install it (once)
and activate it (each time you start Blender, or in your startup file).

To install it, open Blender's User Preferences panel, click the Addons tab,
click the Install Addon button, select import_valkyria-X.X.zip, and click
Install Addon.

To activate it, open Blender's User Preferences panel, click the Addons tab,
find "Import-Export: Valkyria Chronicles (.MLX, .HMD, .ABR)", and click its
checkbox.

Once import_valkyria is installed and activated, you can import a model by
clicking File, Import, Valkyria Chronicles (.MLX, .HMD, .ABR), or by
pressing space, typing valk, and choosing it from the list.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

Blender 2.66 and 2.66a have a bug that causes some textures to be blank in the
viewport and in game mode, but not when rendering. Use 2.65a or 2.67 instead.

Blender frequenty recalculates normal vectors, so there's not really a way to
use the normal vectors specified in the game.

Bones are a little bit weird because this was the best way I could think of to
get bones to correspond to the right vertex groups. Also, armature
relationships that exist in some models (such as between the body armature and
the head armature) are not supported.


CHANGELOG
=========

2013-??-??: Version 0.6
    Added preliminary support (no textures) for ABR models.

2013-05-11: Version 0.5
    Renamed from hmdl_import to import_valkyria.
    Heavily refactored for encapsulation and extensibility.
    Handles bones differently, allowing fingertip articulation.
    Supports shape keys for facial expressions, etc.

2013-04-26: Version 0.4
    Preview release. Poorly coded and poorly documented.
    First release that works in Blender 2.63+
    Has preliminary support for bones.
    Has better support for materials, including normal maps and transparency.
